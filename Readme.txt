The path of the program's execute file is "Random Coordinates\Random Coordinates\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\Random Coordinates.exe".
You must have .net5 on your computer to run the program. If it is not installed, when you click on the execute file,
the system will usually notify you that you need to download it and ask if you want it to be downloaded. If you approve,
 the .net5 download will take place automatically if you are connected to the internet and 
you will be able to run the application without any problems.
